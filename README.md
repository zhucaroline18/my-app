# Sorting Visualized App
The goal of this website is to provide a service where people who are learning about coding and sorting can see what thier code is doing with a visualization of a few of the most common in-place sorting algorithms. As many people learn best by seeing, this will be a good place for beginner coders to start understanding the code they're writing

# Motivation 
With my younger sister starting to learn coding, I thought this would be a good website for her to get started with coding.

# App Features 
- visualization of different sorting algorithms where you can choose to have objects sorted by color or length
- ability to change speed of the sorting
- ability to change the number of items being sorted
- brief explanation and java code of all the visualized algorithms

# Resources used:
- **CSS** - Front end design
- **React** - Front end
- **SVG** - graphics
- **HTML** - Front end design
- **TypeScript** - primary language
- **React Bootstrap** - front end design
- **Azure** - website deployment
- **MDB** (Material Design for Bootstrap 5 and React 18)

# Process 
This project took 2-3 weeks to implement. The relative process is as follows: 
- 1 week conceiving project
- 1-2 days to implement each sorting algorithm and figuring out animation
- 1 week for finishing touches such as speed, color palette, and animation design

# Things I learned 
- how to do simple animations with typescript
- how to deploy a simple website to the internet with Azure
- nuances of typescript such as writing a sleep and timeout function to delay my animations
- working with svg and css in conjunction with my animations
- getting more comfortable with the MDB elements and tools
